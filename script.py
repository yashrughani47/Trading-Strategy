# Let me analyze the CSV import issue and create a more robust CSV parsing solution

csv_analysis = '''
Looking at the CSV data and the issue description, I can see the problem:

1. CSV PARSING ISSUES:
   - Headers and values are not aligning properly
   - Some fields are getting mapped to wrong columns
   - Entry price becomes 0, quantity becomes 0
   - Random data mixing between columns

2. POTENTIAL CAUSES:
   - CSV contains quotes around values with commas (Indian number format)
   - Field parsing is not handling quoted values correctly  
   - Column mapping logic has issues
   - Date parsing inconsistencies

3. CSV DATA ANALYSIS:
   - Entry Price: "4,568.00" (quoted with comma)
   - Some dates: 6/18/202 (incomplete year)
   - Mixed date formats: 2/24/2025, 06-06-2025, 07-02-2025 00:00
   - P&L columns are empty in many rows

4. SOLUTION NEEDED:
   - Robust CSV parsing that handles quoted fields
   - Better column mapping with fallback logic
   - Improved number parsing for Indian format
   - Enhanced date parsing for multiple formats
   - Field validation and error recovery
